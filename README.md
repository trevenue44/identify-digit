# identify-digit
In this repository, I put all my work on developing a really good model that is capable of identifying digits from pictures; both handwritten and typed. By "digits", I mean 0 - 9.

I have a trial version of this model already deployed to https://identifydigit.herokuapp.com/

This current model is really bad and doesn't do all the work. 

In this repository, I'm going to try and create an improved version of this model and keep improving it using my skills on supervised machine learning algorithms.

## The Dataset
The dataset that I'll be using is the MNIST dataset which comes with the Scikit-Learn package.
